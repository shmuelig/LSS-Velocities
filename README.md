These codes contain the full Fisher analysis for density field - either galaxy survey or LIM, and for velocity field. The 3d velocity field is reconstructed using velocity tomography, both using the kSZ effect and the moving-lens effect.
The kSZ power spectrum is calculated seperately using the appropriate code, and used in both the other codes.
